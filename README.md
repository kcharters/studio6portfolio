### Sprint 1
Date: 23/02/21

### Done
- added Rebecca to firebase project
-  added password strength meter from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-password-strength-meter). added html pattern to required password so password min requirements will work on all browsers. 
-  added .env files for production and build to keep our keys secret
-  started google captcha but it needs a domain for api key so the site needs to be hosted first. 
-  fixed sign up and login with [this](https://blog.logrocket.com/vue-firebase-authentication/) tutorial.
